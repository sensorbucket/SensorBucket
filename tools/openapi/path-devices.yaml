  summary: List devices
  description: |
    Fetch a list of devices.
    
    Devices can be filtered on three items: properties, distance from a location or a bounding box.
     - Filtering on properties filters devices on whether their property attribute is a superset of the given JSON object value
     - Distance from location filtering requires a latitude, longitude and distance (in meters). All devices within that range will be returned
     - Bounding box requires a North,East,South and West point. All devices within that box will be returned.

    The filters distance from location and bounding box are mutually exclusive. The location distance filter will take precedence.

    Depending on the type of device and the network it is registered on. The device might need specific properties to be set.  
    **For example:** A LoRaWAN device often requires a `dev_eui` property to be set. The system will match incoming traffic against that property.
