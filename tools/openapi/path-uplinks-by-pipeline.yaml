  summary: Process uplink message
  description: |
    Push an uplink message to the HTTP Importer for processing.

    The request body and content-type can be anything the workers (defined by the pipeline steps) in the pipeline expect.

    As this process is asynchronuous, any processing error will not be returned in the response.
    Only if the HTTP Importer is unable to push the message to the Message Queue, will an error be returned. 
  parameters:
    - name: pipeline_id
      description: The UUID of the pipeline
      in: path
      required: true
