    List all datastreams.

    A sensor can produce one or more timeseries of measurements. Such a unique timeserie is called a datastream.  

    **For example:** A Particulate Matter sensor might return count the number of particles smaller than 2.5 μg/cm2, 5 μg/cm2 and 10 μg/cm2.
    this is one sensor producing three datastreams.

    Another example would be a worker which processes raw incoming values into meaningful data.
    An underwater pressure sensor might supply its measurement in milli Amperes, but the worker converts it to watercolumn in meters.
    The sensor now has two datastreams. Presusre in millivolt and watercolumn in meters.
